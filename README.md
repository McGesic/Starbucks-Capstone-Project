# Starbucks-Capstone-Project

# Motivation for the project
The project was created as a Capstone project of the Udacity Nanodegree Program. It is based on a dataset provided by Starbucks from its rewards mobile app. The key question of the analysis was to determine based on which factors an offer sent via the app was successful and to create a predictor for offer success.
What is the average career satisfaction and average salary of female vs. male SW developers?
